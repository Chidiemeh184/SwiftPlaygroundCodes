//OBSERVATION:
//This is possible and can be done, but it will take more resources beyond the level 
// of this course to accomplish. It can be done easily with array, dictionary or set.
/// Tuples is a simple data structure for temporary use.
// The API Advices
//
//
//Tuples are useful for temporary groups of related values. They are not suited to the creation of complex data structures. If your data structure is likely to persist beyond a temporary scope, model it as a class or structure, rather than as a tuple
